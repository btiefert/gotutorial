Intro
=====

These examples make little sense outside of the tutorial itself.

Slides for the examples will be put up soon.


Getting Started
===============
The simpliest way to get started is to jump into share/vagrant
and "vagrant up". Otherwise, if you're hanging around the
tutorial sessions, there's a prebuilt VM for it.

The VM is basically a CentOS 6 box with golang installed and
OracleASM installed and running on it, if you'd like to build
it yourself.
